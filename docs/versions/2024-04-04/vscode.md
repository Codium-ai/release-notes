# Codiumate VSCode v0.7.5???

## Code Auto-Complete

Did you know we have an auto-complete feature hidden in your settings? Why is it hidden? Well, it is still in beta, but you can use it today and let us know what you think 😁

Simply go to the extension settings -> check `Codium > Code auto-complete`.

You can even add your instructions to the auto-complete suggestions by going to `Codium > Code auto-complete user instrucstion` and adding your own snippets.

We would love to hear if how it worked for you! Share yout thoughts and feedback on our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/codiumai-1057273017547378788).
