## Introducing - Codiumate Coding-Agent!

**Exciting announcement this week** - We have released the first alpha version of our **[Coding-Agent](https://www.codium.ai/products/coding-agent/)** in our VSCode extension!

In Codiumate v0.8 for VSCode, you will find your next best friend: a coding agent that helps you complete any task in your project. Just write the specification, select the relevant context, and let Codiumate write the plan and even auto-complete the code for you!

We are releasing the Codiumate-Agent in its alpha form because we, as developers, believe in giving users the chance to influence the product as early as possible. Additionally, we love seeing our users enjoy what we build.
