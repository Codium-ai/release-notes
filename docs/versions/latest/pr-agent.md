# PR-Agent **Impact**



### 


We’re excited to introduce a powerful new feature in PR-Agent Pro: the PR-Agent **Impact Report**!

<div class="left-padding" markdown>

### What's New?

1. **Impact Report:** Our new impact report showcases a metric that demonstrates how PR-Agent has helped improve the quality of your PRs. This report calculates the number of code suggestions made by PR-Agent that were applied in the PR, providing you with a clear measure of its effectiveness.

2. **Applied Code Suggestions:** Reviewers can now see the applied code suggestions directly within the PR itself. This transparency makes it easier to track changes and understand the improvements made.

# Follow **Best Practices**

<div class="left-padding" markdown>

We’re excited to announce a powerful new feature in Codiumate: **Follow Company Best Practices**. This feature introduces a dedicated wiki page, best_practices.md, allowing you to set specific guidelines and standards for your repository or organization. The AI model will use this page to ensure that code suggestions adheres to your best practices, suggesting improvements and applying a dedicated label—"Organization best practice"—when guidelines are not met.

#### Examples of best practices: 

- Clear and Concise Writing: Ensure guidelines are easily understandable.
- Relevant Code Snippets: Provide short examples to illustrate key points.
- Document Length: Keep the file up to 800 lines for optimal use.
