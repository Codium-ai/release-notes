## Introducing Threads
We are excited to announce a new feature that many of you have eagerly anticipated —

The **Threads** functionality is now available in the Codiumate Chat plugin for JetBrains!
🎉🎉🎉

### What are Threads?

Threads are a dynamic tool in Codiumate designed to enhance your interactions with the AI. This feature enables you to dive deeper into discussions, refine responses, and extend conversations to achieve more targeted outcomes. Through Threads, you can iteratively adjust results, seek additional insights, or steer dialogues toward more precise conclusions. Activate a thread by clicking the `Continue this Chat` button at the end of a response to develop initial answers into fully fleshed-out solutions.

## Enhanced Command Support

We have expanded the command repertoire in Codiumate Chat’s File Mode:

- `/quick-test` - Initiates an interactive, iterative mode to generate essential test suites swiftly, targeting key functionalities. This is a streamlined alternative to the more exhaustive `/test-suite` command. **[Read More](https://codiumate-docs.codium.ai/chat/commands/quick-test/)**.
- `/find-on-github` - This command integrates your coding environment with the expansive universe of GitHub’s open-source projects. It allows you to select a code snippet and find similar code in GitHub repositories. **[Read More](https://codiumate-docs.codium.ai/chat/commands/find-on-github/)**.

## What’s Next?

- We plan to integrate additional commands such as `/enhance` and `/improve` into our File Mode chat.
- Further enhancements to Workspace Mode are on the horizon, with a focus on Local Changes as well as Committed Changes, enabling you to review modifications before pushing them to your branch.
- We are also developing new commands for Workspace Mode, including `/issues` and `/recap`.

**Stay Tuned!**
