# Introducing: **Threads**

We are excited to announce a new feature that many of you have eagerly anticipated:

#### The Threads functionality is now available in the Codiumate Chat plugin for JetBrains!
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### What are **Threads**?

Threads are a dynamic tool in Codiumate designed to enhance your interactions with the AI. This feature enables you to dive deeper into discussions, refine responses, and extend conversations to achieve more targeted outcomes. 

Through Threads, you can iteratively adjust results, seek additional insights, or steer dialogues toward more precise conclusions. 

Activate a thread by clicking the `Continue this Chat` button at the end of a response to develop initial answers into fully fleshed-out solutions.

# Enhanced **Command** Support

We have expanded the command repertoire in Codiumate Chatâ€™s File Mode:



<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-lightning-bolt:{ .lg .middle } `/quick-test`

    ---

    Initiates an interactive, iterative mode to generate essential test suites swiftly, targeting key functionalities. This is a streamlined alternative to the more exhaustive `/test-suite` command.

-   :material-github:{ .lg .middle } `/find-on-github`

    ---

    This command integrates your coding environment with the expansive universe of GitHubâ€™s open-source projects. It allows you to select a code snippet and find similar code in GitHub repositories.
