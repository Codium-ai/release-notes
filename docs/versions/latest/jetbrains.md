# New **Advanced Test** Panel!

<div class="left-padding" markdown>
Ladies and Gents, we have a fantastic new addition to Codiumate for JetBrains — our all-new Advanced Panel! This latest update brings a host of exciting features designed to make your development experience smoother, smarter, and more efficient.
### Here's what's new:

1. **Sleek New Look and Feel:** We’ve given the Advanced Panel a complete makeover. Enjoy a cleaner, more intuitive interface that makes navigating and utilizing Codiumate easier than ever before.
2. **Context Tab:** Now, you can see all the context we've collected for your tests at a glance. This new tab ensures you have all the relevant information you need right where you need it.
3. **Configuration Tab:** Customizing your testing environment has never been simpler. With our new configuration tab, you can easily set parameters like frameworks, example tests, and extra instructions. Plus, you can save these settings directly to a configuration file right from the tab!

# **Code-Completion** is now available!

Code Completion by Codiumate is a powerful tool designed to accelerate your coding process, reducing the need for repetitive tasks such as copying and pasting code snippets from the internet. By enabling Code Completion, Codiumate learns from your codebase and provides real-time suggestions that seamlessly integrate with your writing flow.

Our paying users can now enjoy this feature on JetBrains, by enabling it in the Codiumate plugin settings.
