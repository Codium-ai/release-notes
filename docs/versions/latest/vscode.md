## New! Chat Just Got Smarter with Image Integration

Now you can simply paste images right into the chat in both Free Chat and our new Coding Agent! This cool new feature lets you ask questions about the images you upload. Want the HTML code for a design? Just upload the image. Got a UML diagram? Let the Coding Agent map it out for you. 

Itâ€™s all about making your chat experience as helpful and interactive as possible. 

Dive in and see what you can create!

Last week we have released our new [Coding-Agent](../2024-04-04/index.md) in our VSCode extension, and we are excited to see how many of you have already tried it out! We hope that this new feature will make your coding experience even more efficient and enjoyable.

This week we improved our Coding-Agent, fixed some issues around it, and we're going to improve it even more in the upcoming weeks. **Stay tuned for more updates!**

## Bug fixes

1. We resolved an issue in the thread where it previously stopped responding.
2. We also fixed a problem in a thread involving code, where the thread was losing the initial context.
