### Supported Commands and Modes

All the previous commands and modes that were supported in the previous design is also supported in the new design, it just looks a bit different.

Instead of "Code Assistant" and "PR Assistant" tabs, you now have a drop-down with all the supported modes:

- **Free Chat mode** - for code-related chat with ChatGPT
- **File mode** - select component or code snippet and choose a command with `/`
- **Workspace mode** - currently supports Committed Changes (like before)

We are adding all the other modes and commands, you will see a `SOON` label near them.
