Ladies and Gents, we have a fantastic new addition to Codiumate for JetBrains â€” our all-new Advanced Panel! This latest update brings a host of exciting features designed to make your development experience smoother, smarter, and more efficient.

### Here's what's new:

1. **Sleek New Look and Feel:** Weâ€™ve given the Advanced Panel a complete makeover. Enjoy a cleaner, more intuitive interface that makes navigating and utilizing Codiumate easier than ever before.

2. **Context Tab:** Now, you can see all the context we've collected for your tests at a glance. This new tab ensures you have all the relevant information you need right where you need it.

3. **Configuration Tab:** Customizing your testing environment has never been simpler. With our new configuration tab, you can easily set parameters like frameworks, example tests, and extra instructions. Plus, you can save these settings directly to a configuration file right from the tab!

# PR-Agent **Impact**


<div class="left-padding" markdown>

### 


Weâ€™re excited to introduce a powerful new feature in PR-Agent Pro: the PR-Agent **Impact Report**!

### What's New?

1. **Impact Report:** Our new impact report showcases a metric that demonstrates how PR-Agent has helped improve the quality of your PRs. This report calculates the number of code suggestions made by PR-Agent that were applied in the PR, providing you with a clear measure of its effectiveness.

2. **Applied Code Suggestions:** Reviewers can now see the applied code suggestions directly within the PR itself. This transparency makes it easier to track changes and understand the improvements made.
