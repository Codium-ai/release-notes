## Codiumate for VSCode

**[See full Release Notes](./versions/latest/vscode.md)**

### New! Chat Just Got Smarter with Image Integration

Now you can simply paste images right into the chat in both Free Chat and our new Coding Agent! This cool new feature lets you ask questions about the images you upload. Want the HTML code for a design? Just upload the image. Got a UML diagram? Let the Coding Agent map it out for you.

Itâ€™s all about making your chat experience as helpful and interactive as possible.

Dive in and see what you can create!

## Codiumate for JetBrains

**[See full Release Notes](./versions/latest/jetbrains.md)**

### Threads are now available in the Codiumate Chat plugin for JetBrains!

Threads are a dynamic tool in Codiumate designed to enhance your interactions with the AI. This feature enables you to dive deeper into discussions, refine responses, and extend conversations to achieve more targeted outcomes. Through Threads, you can iteratively adjust results, seek additional insights, or steer dialogues toward more precise conclusions. Activate a thread by clicking the `Continue this Chat` button at the end of a response to develop initial answers into fully fleshed-out solutions.
